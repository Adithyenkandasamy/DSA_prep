## SUBJECTIVE QUES -

1. What is the Difference Between a Shallow Copy and Deep Copy?
Deepcopy creates a different object and populates it with the child objects of the original object. Therefore, changes in the original object are not reflected in the copy.
        copy.deepcopy() creates a Deep Copy.

        Shallow copy creates a different object and populates it with the references of the child objects within the original object. Therefore, changes in the original object are reflected in the copy.

        copy.copy creates a Shallow Copy.


2. How is Memory managed in Python?
    ## Python has a private heap space that stores all the objects. The Python memory manager regulates various aspects of this heap, such as sharing, caching, segmentation, and allocation. The user has no control over the heap; only the Python interpreter has access.
